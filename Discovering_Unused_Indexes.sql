--SYS.DM_DB_INDEX_USAGE_STATS shows you how many times the index was used for user queries

--The seeks refer to how many times an index seek occurred for that index.  A seek is the fastest way to access the data, so this is good.
--The scans refers to how many times an index scan occurred for that index.  A scan is when multiple rows of data had to be searched to find the data.  Scans are something you want to try to avoid.
--The lookups refer to how many times the query required data to be pulled from the clustered index or the heap (does not have a clustered index).  Lookups are also something you want to try to avoid.
--The updates refers to how many times the index was updated due to data changes which should correspond to the first query above.

--If there are indexes with no seeks, scans or lookups, but there are updates this means that SQL Server has not used the 
--index to satisfy a query but still needs to maintain the index
